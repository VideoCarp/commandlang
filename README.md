# Command Lang
A language like Lisp but without overwhelming parentheses.
WIP rn. 
# Syntax
`[(] <command> <argument1>, <argument2>, ... [)];`
The syntax is extremely simple. Use parentheses (`(` and `)`) like you would in maths.
And to nest command calls. 
A command call is a function call.
For example: `print (add 5, 1);`
or `print "Hello World!";`.
